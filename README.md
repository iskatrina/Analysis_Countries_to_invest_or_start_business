# WIP
**Main goal**: practise analyzing data with Python and communicate findings. Analysis has been done purelly for educational purpose.
<br> **used libraries**: NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib

**Subject**: Which countries are good for investment or start running a business, based on dataset obtained from  https://www.gapminder.org/data/ ,for timeframe 
mainly 2012-2018.

**Limitations**:
 Datasets source is supposed to be rather for educational reason and can't garanty high accuracy and be 100% reliable for any actionables

1. Datasets had a lot of missing values, and due to that many observations has to be dropped/filled, and some years intervals hast to be cut of to keep integrity of time period for all data sets. Dataset of Master degrees by country suffered from missing values the most. But no better dataset could be found, which could tell about level of high education by country 
2. Some findings suggested good level of development in some countries, although during 1912-1918 year,and no data after year 2018 were available to confirm that trend. **
